# Education Dropouts

In Bangladesh, 40% of students dropouts from their educational institutions on a certain stage of their studies. As per the government, till August, 2018 the percentage of literate people is approximately 73%. This measurement is based on **if the student passed the primary level or not**. Then the liability of the government is over and the further studies must be continued by the student's own interest. If they have the support and courage they continue their studies otherwise we mark them as dropouts!
 
 ___Our Task:___ Our task is to predict the students who will dropout in future. Then take necessary steps to encourage the students for further studies.
 
 ___How?:___ So, how gonna do that? As it a prediction based study, thus we meed Machine Learning tools. First, we need to collect data from several schools for several students. The data may contain student's - father's income, property, attendance, marks, previous results, family bonding etc. Based on those data we'll create learning model to predict.
